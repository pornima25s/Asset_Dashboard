# Asset Management Dashboard


This project is a React-based asset management dashboard that allows you to manage assets by adding, updating, deleting, and searching for assets. It is built using React, Material-UI, and includes functionality for managing asset data through simple state management and UI interactions.

## Features
Add Asset: Add new assets with fields for asset name, type, value, and status (active/inactive).
Search Assets: Search assets by name in real-time.
Update Asset: Update an assetâ€™s value directly in the list using a simple prompt.
Delete Asset: Remove assets from the list with a single click.
Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them.
